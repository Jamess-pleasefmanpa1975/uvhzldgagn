Just walked outta Rosario, wow, like being slapped by a pizza box full of emotions and confusion, my head’s still spinning, you know? The theater was buzzing, like a coffee pot left on too long, popping sounds from burnt popcorn still echoing. My back be protesting like it’s trying to be the star of its own tragic opera.  

Rosario. Man, talk about whirlwind. It’s like, how do you even begin to jam all those colors and sounds into words? I swear, I spent half the time just trying to decipher the lead character’s intentions — like trying to read a cat’s mind while it’s being served sushi. Did she love him? Did she even know what love felt like? Like, whoa.  

> That scene where she just stares into the abyss of her own reflection. It’s like looking into a puddle after rain, but there’s a monster in the water grinning back. Ugh, makes you think of those moments when you argue with yourself over 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥𝘪𝘯𝘨 another   instead of hitting “𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  .”   

And, did you notice how the soundtrack just barged into scenes uninvited? Loud and suddenly like my neighbor’s dog when I’m sneaking in a midnight sandwich. It gave those important scenes this weird anxiety buzz, like an over-caffeinated bee in your ear, yeah?  

Popcorn crumbs sticking to my fingers, sticky like the plot twists in this thing — you think you got it then BAM, it’s a whole different creature. Heck, at one point, I thought I was in an entirely different   like some kinda abrupt channel change. And those tears, who’s tears were they? Hers? Ours? The ceiling’s? Oh man.  

That ending tho… as inexplicable and random as my uncle’s collection of antique biscuit tins. Why did he do it? Why did she smile? Heck, why was there a horse in the last scene? Call center operators like me, we’re supposed to figure stuff out not leave theaters more baffled than without electricity during a storm.  

Gotta say, though, Rosario kinda leaves a mark on your mind like ink smudges on an old love letter — messy, convoluted, but somehow all the more genuine. You really start pondering whether love’s just random scenes stitched together.  

Anyway man, enough of my rambling. You gotta go 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , get lost in this kaleidoscope yourself, you’ll see. Did you remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Something in there might just give you a dream or two.
